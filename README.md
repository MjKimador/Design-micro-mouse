This project includes two subsystems.
The power subsytem has files named with the suffix Power.
The sensing subsystems has files named with suffix Sensing.
There are two branches through which changes are made and the main branch holds files for both sensing subsystem and power subsystem.

For the Power Subsystem:
This system has been designed to provide power to the micro mouse system. It is designed using kiCad and to open the file you can open the .pro file and you will haev the entire project including the pcb files and schematic. The files used for ordering which inlude BOM files and all other files are not included in this folder but the project has all fields filled makingh it possible for all required files to be opened with ease.

For the Sensing Subsystem:
The subsystem serves as the sensory "eyes" of the micromouse, detecting obstacles in its path and facilitating navigation. It integrates easily with other features, ensuring efficient power usage and reliable obstacle detection within budgetary constraints.The design was done using kicad .The documents included are pcb ,schenatic and datasheet of components used.
